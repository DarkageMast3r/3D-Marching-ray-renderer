If you want to view the source for this project, download the main.lua and shader.glsl.
main.lua sets everything up for usage, and shader.glsl does all the rendering.

WASD + Left shift + Space to move
Click and move mouse to rotate camera
T to enable/disable shadows

Camera movement doesn't completely follow the rotation for whatever reason, and I can't be bothered fixing it.
