If you want to view the source for this project, download the main.lua and shader.glsl in the source folder.
main.lua sets everything up for usage, and shader.glsl does all the rendering.

If you don't have the Love2D engine, download everything except for the source folder, and then execute the executable.

WASD + Left shift + Space to move
Click and move mouse to rotate camera
T to enable/disable shadows

Camera movement doesn't completely follow the rotation for whatever reason, and I can't be bothered fixing it.
